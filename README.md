# Project-1

Hi, I'm Jhonatan Cenepo Borbor. I am a Bachelor of Business Administration, but I love technology and application development.
I'm going back to my code classes, because I want to do what I'm passionate about.
This page is the first one I have created and I will continue creating more.
Thanks.
